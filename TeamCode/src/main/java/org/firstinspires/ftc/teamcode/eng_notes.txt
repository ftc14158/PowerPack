Measured wheel ticks - actually 4 * teh ticks per revolution given on Andymark site

Fixed bug in mecanumDrivetrain set up - had FL motor listed twice in motor setup array by mistake
After fix, wheel encoders are reporting correct distance in mm

Established that feed forward default param kv=1 overrides the PID parameters even if all set to 0
Added config for PID and KVA coefficients and ste them up in mecanumDrivetrain subsystem

Added command to reset motors with latest coefficient constants when Y pressed on gamepad

Experimented with PID settings but not very successful. Any D co-efficient causes oscillation. Maybe need I

Updated drive function to use squared joystick inputs for easier driving
